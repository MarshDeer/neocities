				In her "ethics of boinking animal people", Patricia says Bicycle was meant to create the same "furry species euphoria through textural sound design" that Alexander Panos's accidentally did in his album "Nascent". Needless to say, she succeeded! I am not therian myself, but I went into the album with that in mind and did get some degree of that almost-tactile feeling of being a lil deer.

			<p>
				Good shit! Super strong start to the year. This album feels amazing to listen to and will definitely be one of my most listened this year.

				Found this album through a youtube recommendation about Club Penguin's music. I was particularly drawn to the "found footage" concept; I think it's fascinating how *palpable* the caller's excitement was in "I Am Truly Fully Licensed Hairstylist" in particular. I thought it was interesting how the album immortalized her excitement at that particular moment of her life, idk. I felt happy for her all the way from over 20 years into the future, and I think that's cool.

				When I got handed this book I was told it was "a political allegory about workers overthrowing their opressors", so I got excited and essentially expected it to be a more modern Animal Farm. Sadly, the book did not deliver.
			</p>
			<p>
				It suffers from an issue worryingly common in xenofiction stories with thinly-veiled allegories for a worker class: that one fucking trope where, while the workers can organize together and overthrow their oppressors, they eventually self-destruct because they are incompetent or biologically incapable of creative/independent thought. These stories, then, often go one of three ways: they give an anti-revolutionary message by framing overthrowing the ruling class as a fatal mistake with ramifications too complex for the oppressed's inferior minds to understand; they serve as colonialist propaganda by having the protagonist (often an outsider) step up as a natural leader with their superior creativity and/or intellect; or they frame ecocidal oppressors as the "lesser evil" at best or misunderstood good guys at worst by eventually returning to a marginally less oppressive status quo, usually with taken-down-a-peg oppressors still holding most (if not all) of the power.
			</p>
			<p>
				Needless to say, I fucking hate this trope, and was left extremely disappointed with the book. My instinct is to assume Liu's cultural context of growing up in Great Cultural Revolution-era China musthave painted his decision to include this trope in the book, he openly supported the country's government's antidemocratic mass control/surveillance policies and the Uyghur genocide during a The New Yorker interview in 2019, after all... But I admittedly don't know enough Chinese history to be fully sure this assumption doesn't come from internalized sinophobia, so don't quote me on this hot take I guess; I'm fully ready to drop it if I'm wrong.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anyways. What I'm trying to say here is that Pixar's A Bug's Life did the ants-as-workers concept better.

				I found Hundred Rabbits' website a couple days ago. I spent a good chunk of today going through the huge amount of tabs from their website I had accumulated, leaving the open-source version of this book for last.
			</p>
			<p>
				I find Rekka and Devine's  situation extremely interesting. Their interests and thoughts mirror my own in many ways, so since I found out about them I've spent an embarassing amount of time thinking about what it would be like to live on a sailboat myself; to figure things out to a point where I could leave my deeply unsatisfying job behind and spend my energy and resources doing something more satisfying and closer to what I would like than, well, whatever the fuck it is I'm doing now.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm a bit sleepy right now, so I can't express my thoughts too coherently. The point is that I found the book extremely interesting and I'll probably be rotating it in my head for the next couple days.

				I feel like I can't talk about this book fairly. It's blatantly obvious to me that I am way past its target audience, and I stray further away from it every year; however, this shit would've changed my life if it had come out 12 years ago, and it apparently has been extremely formative to lots of young queer people, so I respect it for that.
			</p>
			<p>
				This volume starts bridging the gap between Volume 4 and the "Nick and Charlie" novella. It spends a lot of time doing what feels like just setting up that book's themes and conflict, but it writes itself into a corner where it tries to give those themes some degree of closure without making the novella redundant. Ultimately, I don't think Volume 5 achieves that balance, and its overall quality dearly suffers from it.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was a cozy, quick read that felt like what my experience growing up as the only openly queer kid in my environment could have been like in a better world. I can't deny I enjoyed that, but my issues with the "we have to eventually get to the novella" narrative sadly made that wish fulfillment the only part I actually liked... It was fine, I guess?

				This fills the exact same "book that makes you feel bad but is imossible to put down" niche as "I'm glad my mom died" for me, except I feel more strongly about all the trauma I've faced because of my queerness than my family-related one, so it hit significantly harder.

				I... Didn't really get this movie?
			</p>
			<p>
				It was absolutely gorgeous visually! Hell, at many points I basically felt like I was right there in the movie's rural setting, but the pacing felt a bit odd? Which is okay! But it took me out of the movie (to its detriment) a couple times. My thoughts will probably change on a rewatch, though.
			</p>
			<p>
				After looking it up, it seems to be a very personal movie for Miyazaki, and I can kind of see why. I can draw the connections/parallels and I see how this movie had a certain air of "finality" to it: I think there is more of a chance of this one actually being his last movie, in a way? Not just because of his age, it just felt like a clearer and better farewell to his career than The Wind Rises was over 10 years ago... I just couldn't connect with it at all, so it ended up being my least favorite Miyazaki movie for no fault of its own :c

				As a Latin American, I have obviously been exposed to Soda a LOT, so they've wormed their way into my list of "bands I always enjoy when they come on" without (but not necessarily against) my will. I like them! They're chill, I have vague nostalgia of hearing them in the radio when I was a child and such... But I admittedly had only paid attention to their most overplayed albums, so I somehow got myself into a situation where I have been on this Earth for 26 whole years and yet I just learned they made a shoegaze-y album. Naturally, I had to go listen to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dynamo was fun! It was initially a bit jarring to hear Cerati's voice along the textures I usually associate with, like, MBV or Cocteau Twins, but it led to a super pleasant listening experience. I'm not sure I'll revisit it too often in the future (not that into shoegaze these days, that's angsty 2020 Lena's genre), but I definitely had fun with it today~

				I don't really remember how this album got on my backlog and it's been a weird day energy-wise so I don't think I have much to say about this album atm :c It was a fun listen for sure, though!

				Patricia Taxxon recommended this album on her Tumblr. SO FUCKING GLAD I put it in my backlog bc holy shit. Its name 100% did NOT prepare me for how much it would slap.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wonderful energy, lyrics, and production. It just kept getting better??? This hits the hyper-specific niche of hyperpop that makes me go fucking wild, and I'm v glad Patty recommended it.
			</p>
			<p>
				...Fuck, am I in my hyperpop era?

				This is, like, the 7th Loveless cover album in my library lmao.
			</p>
			<p>
				This album comes as some sort of response to a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ngdUiecnVw">mashup</a> between MBV's "When You Sleep" and Bad Bunny's "Tenemos Que Hablar" YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjSihp3YYIun_LSPoe21eVw">@JokoPlayBass</a> posted in early 2019. It was WAY better than it had any right to, so people went fucking nuts over it until someone finally did mashups for the entire album.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's good! Like, its premise is inherently funny, but lots of the mashups are actually pretty enjoyable~ I'll probably end up listening to it every now and then?
