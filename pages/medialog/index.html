				In her "ethics of boinking animal people", Patricia says Bicycle was meant to create the same "furry species euphoria through textural sound design" that Alexander Panos's accidentally did in his album "Nascent". Needless to say, she succeeded! I am not therian myself, but I went into the album with that in mind and did get some degree of that almost-tactile feeling of being a lil deer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Good shit! Super strong start to the year. This album feels amazing to listen to and will definitely be one of my most listened this year.

				Found this album through a youtube recommendation about Club Penguin's music. I was particularly drawn to the "found footage" concept; I think it's fascinating how *palpable* the caller's excitement was in "I Am Truly Fully Licensed Hairstylist" in particular. I thought it was interesting how the album immortalized her excitement at that particular moment of her life, idk. I felt happy for her all the way from over 20 years into the future, and I think that's cool.

				My Car Seat Headrest hyperfixation phase is long gone, but they remain a very important band for me. I listened to Twin Fantasy on loop around the time I started HRT in 2020, when I was finally starting to have some hope for the future for the first time in many, many years.

				I usually don't listen to live albums, but CSH gets special treatment. It... It was a live album, I guess? I had fun listening to it, but I don't think I have much to say about it apart from that.

				I admittedly know very little about rap/hip-hop, but this album's emotional content hit for me, and I've been told that's what these genres are supposed to be about?
			</p>
			<p>
				I don't have many distilled thoughts about this album, just that I've listened to each of its tracks multiple times just the day after first listening to them, so at least that shows how much I enjoyed it.

			<p>
				When I got handed this book I was told it was "a political allegory about workers overthrowing their opressors", so I got excited and essentially expected it to be a more modern Animal Farm. Sadly, the book did not deliver.
			</p>
			<p>
				It suffers from an issue worryingly common in xenofiction stories with thinly-veiled allegories for a worker class: that one fucking trope where, while the workers can organize together and overthrow their oppressors, they eventually self-destruct because they are incompetent or biologically incapable of creative/independent thought. These stories, then, often go one of three ways: they give an anti-revolutionary message by framing overthrowing the ruling class as a fatal mistake with ramifications too complex for the oppressed's inferior minds to understand; they serve as colonialist propaganda by having the protagonist (often an outsider) step up as a natural leader with their superior creativity and/or intellect; or they frame ecocidal oppressors as the "lesser evil" at best or misunderstood good guys at worst by eventually returning to a marginally less oppressive status quo, usually with taken-down-a-peg oppressors still holding most (if not all) of the power.
			</p>
			<p>
				Needless to say, I fucking hate this trope, and was left extremely disappointed with the book. My instinct is to assume Liu's cultural context of growing up in Great Cultural Revolution-era China musthave painted his decision to include this trope in the book, he openly supported the country's government's antidemocratic mass control/surveillance policies and the Uyghur genocide during a The New Yorker interview in 2019, after all... But I admittedly don't know enough Chinese history to be fully sure this assumption doesn't come from internalized sinophobia, so don't quote me on this hot take I guess; I'm fully ready to drop it if I'm wrong.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anyways. What I'm trying to say here is that Pixar's A Bug's Life did the ants-as-workers concept better.

				I found Hundred Rabbits' website a couple days ago. I spent a good chunk of today going through the huge amount of tabs from their website I had accumulated, leaving the open-source version of this book for last.
			</p>
			<p>
				I find Rekka and Devine's  situation extremely interesting. Their interests and thoughts mirror my own in many ways, so since I found out about them I've spent an embarassing amount of time thinking about what it would be like to live on a sailboat myself; to figure things out to a point where I could leave my deeply unsatisfying job behind and spend my energy and resources doing something more satisfying and closer to what I would like than, well, whatever the fuck it is I'm doing now.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm a bit sleepy right now, so I can't express my thoughts too coherently. The point is that I found the book extremely interesting and I'll probably be rotating it in my head for the next couple days.

				I enjoyed this book a lot. I was a bit tired of reading more fatalist texts, and it was nice to finally find a full book advocating against non-violence in the climate space specifically.

				I feel like I can't talk about this book fairly. It's blatantly obvious to me that I am way past its target audience, and I stray further away from it every year; however, this shit would've changed my life if it had come out 12 years ago, and it apparently has been extremely formative to lots of young queer people, so I respect it for that.
			</p>
			<p>
				This volume starts bridging the gap between Volume 4 and the "Nick and Charlie" novella. It spends a lot of time doing what feels like just setting up that book's themes and conflict, but it writes itself into a corner where it tries to give those themes some degree of closure without making the novella redundant. Ultimately, I don't think Volume 5 achieves that balance, and its overall quality dearly suffers from it.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was a cozy, quick read that felt like what my experience growing up as the only openly queer kid in my environment could have been like in a better world. I can't deny I enjoyed that, but my issues with the "we have to eventually get to the novella" narrative sadly made that wish fulfillment the only part I actually liked... It was fine, I guess?

				Oooooh boy this one was a heavy read.
			</p>
			<p>
				This fills the exact same "book that makes you feel bad but is imossible to put down" niche as "I'm glad my mom died" for me, except I feel more strongly about all the trauma I've faced because of my queerness than my family-related one, so it hit significantly harder. Like, fuck, if I had been in her position I would've done the same and much, much worse.
			</p>
			<p>
				idk, man. I really fucking feel for her. Chelsea deserved so so so much better and I really hope she's doing alright now.

				I... Didn't really get this movie?
			</p>
			<p>
				It was absolutely gorgeous visually! Hell, at many points I basically felt like I was right there in the movie's rural setting, but the pacing felt a bit odd? Which is okay! But it took me out of the movie (to its detriment) a couple times. My thoughts will probably change on a rewatch, though.
			</p>
			<p>
				After looking it up, it seems to be a very personal movie for Miyazaki, and I can kind of see why. I can draw the connections/parallels and I see how this movie had a certain air of "finality" to it: I think there is more of a chance of this one actually being his last movie, in a way? Not just because of his age, it just felt like a clearer and better farewell to his career than The Wind Rises was over 10 years ago... I just couldn't connect with it at all, so it ended up being my least favorite Miyazaki movie for no fault of its own :c

				Desightful textures and mood through the entire album. Sadly, I still don't have much of a vocabulary to share my thoughts on this sort of IDM-y sound design-heavy music, so I can't properly articulate my enjoyment of it beyond that :c
			</p>
			<p>
				I intended to listen to it as I worked on the website and it ended up holding my attention hostage for the entirety of its runtime. Good shit.

				As a Latin American, I have obviously been exposed to Soda a LOT, so they've wormed their way into my list of "bands I always enjoy when they come on" without (but not necessarily against) my will. I like them! They're chill, I have vague nostalgia of hearing them in the radio when I was a child and such... But I admittedly had only paid attention to their most overplayed albums, so I somehow got myself into a situation where I have been on this Earth for 26 whole years and yet I just learned they made a shoegaze-y album. Naturally, I had to go listen to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dynamo was fun! It was initially a bit jarring to hear Cerati's voice along the textures I usually associate with, like, MBV or Cocteau Twins, but it led to a super pleasant listening experience. I'm not sure I'll revisit it too often in the future (not that into shoegaze these days, that's angsty 2020 Lena's genre), but I definitely had fun with it today~

				uH, I had my MLP phase through the first 2 years of highschool, so it was obviously an extremely formative period for me. This album really encapsulates the experience of growing up and finding yourself in the 2010s, idk.

				It hits GREAT musically too. The production quality took me by surprise a ton of times, and it somehow manages to do a good job at all the genres it goes through (including fucking CUMBIA??????).

				This is, like, the 7th Loveless cover album in my library lmao.
			</p>
			<p>
				This album comes as some sort of response to a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ngdUiecnVw">mashup</a> between MBV's "When You Sleep" and Bad Bunny's "Tenemos Que Hablar" YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjSihp3YYIun_LSPoe21eVw">@JokoPlayBass</a> posted in early 2019. It was WAY better than it had any right to, so people went fucking nuts over it until someone finally did mashups for the entire album.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's good! Like, its premise is inherently funny, but lots of the mashups are actually pretty enjoyable~ I'll probably end up listening to it every now and then?

				I originally got this book the day it released, but a lot of shit got in the way and I never got around to reading it until today. README.TXT left me in the mood for books about whistleblowers, I guess.
			</p>
			<p>
			I enjoyed it a bunch, and it kinda reminded me to tie up a couple opsec loose ends I had been neglecting for a while (deleting unused accounts and such, for the most part). I have been thinking about how my interest in these topics has probably made me a "person of interest" since I was around 12 y/o (hi to the intelligence agents reading this! go whisteblow, quit your job, or fucking die! <s>also plz tell me if id be denied entry to the us itd be so funny</s>) and, like, how that means I prrrrrrobably should take encryption and security a bit more seriously? I already take a non-negligible amount of measures, but they are DEFINITELY not enough lmfao... Just couldn't be assed to set up full disk encryption when I installed my OS, and I need my main storage drive to be compatible with my Windows partition anyways (not for long!), so ugh.
			</p>
				I think it's fascinating how a lot of the stuff mentioned in this book is slightly outdated as of me writing this, with the electronic privacy/freedom landscape looking progressively more and more grim in ways one couldn't have even predicted in 2013. It remains relevant, of course, it just was very clearly written before the NFT and LLM/"AI" bubbles... It doesn't take away from the book's content, it just felt weirdly similar to reading something written "pre-Snowden", ironically!
			</p>
			<p>
				I recommend it. 10/10 would get tracked again. Abolish the US.

				Listened to this to distract myself from today's incredibly hot temperatures. It worked! Though it was a bit harsher than the noise I usually listen to? My wife said, and I quote, "this sounds exactly like [her] anxiety while [she's] at uni".
			</p>
			<p>
				It has an interesting "acoustic" sound to it. I wonder how its recording process went, like, there are some parts where it straight-up sounds like a recording of someone dropping a bunch of cymbals in an empty storeroom. It's great lmao.

				Honestly, it's probably hard to say something about Balatro that hasn't been said in the past couple weeks since its launch. It's an extremely fun and rewarding to learn deckbuilder game with simple mechanics, and everything about its progression feels perfectly tuned to make it enjoyable for my lil' deer brain.
			</p>
			<p>
				I haven't beaten it yet, but I've been doing super well in my last couple runs so I probably should get to that point in the next couple days. I'm not sure for how long I'll keep playing after finishing at least one successful run, but so far it's been a great game I can recommend to pretty much anyone.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a funny little side-note, I got Inscryption'd by it at the start. Like, I was fully expecting my first run to end with some sort of fucked up tone/genre shift into analog horror, but... Nope! Just a delightful little game. Hope someone makes a Vita or HTML5 port soon, bc I'd love to be able to play this while on the subway and stuff.

				I've been trying to "get into" Autechre. I know they fall squarely within a bunch of genre intersections I really enjoy, and they influenced some of my favorite musicians, so I decided to gradually listen to their entire discography. However, it took a while for their stuff to hit strongly enough that I actually sat through an entire album without getting distracted or switching it off for one or another reason.
			</p>
			<p>
				EP7 is the first of their albums I can happily, earnestly say I enjoyed. I don't know if I just happened to be in the right mood for it or if Autechre's style changed in any way when this album released, but it hit and it hit HARD. Good shit. I'm much more excited to listen to the rest of their discography now~

				Decided to watch this on a whim after seeing a gifset on Tumblr.
			</p>
			<p>
				It clearly shows its age, but I personally enjoy old anime significantly more than new ones, so it wasn't too much of an issue. The plot isn't too big of a deal, at times it feels more like an excuse to move the animation project forwards, but honestly that's fine for how short it is.
			</p>
			<p>
				What took me by surprise was how good this was at maintaining a high level of tension for most of its duration. It excels where many, many others have failed, and it comes out the other side as a very fun worthwhile watch. I do recommend it!

				Finally listened to this, my first MF DOOM, on a friend's recommendation.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm borderline ashamed to say I didn't enjoy it much, at least on an aesthetic level. This is not a comment on the album's quality, of course, but on how little I know/understand about this genre and how that affects my enjoyment of it. I could tell it was a good album technically and artistically, I was just unable to connect much to it despite my best efforts/attempts at giving it a proper critical listen.

				Actually bothered listening to this album by building and loading the kernel module.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like, look, I'm not going to pretend a good chunk of my enjoyment of this album came from its novel presentation, but I still do think it's a fascinating, very creative piece of experimental ambient music. I originally expected it to be completely live-synthesized on the spot, so the acoustic and improvisational (I was originally going to say "non-generative", but what is improvisation but generative music ig) elements came as a delightful surprise.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm relistening to a couple tracks via the album's Bandcamp page as I type this short review almost two months after first listening to it through the "proper" medium, and my enjoyment of it stayed the same, so I guess that's testament that it's worth listening to even if you're not into the concept of fucking building your albums from source.

				I did NOT expect K² to come back!

				My chiptune experience is woefully limited beyond "game music", so this album expanded my perception of the genre's emotional/stylistic potential way more than I should probably feel comfortable admitting. Lots of variety!

				I'm not sure if I've stated it here before, but Emma's creative ethos is very inspiring to me, and this album (like all her others) did make me want to make more computer art, so hey, ty Em.

				Hoo boy. This was an interesting one.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am very aware of these strips' importance to queer history, and I really value that. It was fascinating seeing how many of the issues we had in the mid 80s are still relevant today, and how timeless a good chunk of the strips were! Despite the extremely obvious generational gap between Alison Bechdel and me, I did greatly enjoy reading through these.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, I did feel like they suffered a lot just from being newspaper strips. I have to wonder how this would have worked as visual novels or another medium less limited by page sizes and publication schedules, and I do feel weird about how unceremoniously the entire project ended. I wonder how that one Audio Drama version worked out?

				I feel like this book kinda redeemed her for me after the fucking trainwreck that was Are You My Mother. If Fun Home was about her father and the second memoir was about her mother, this one was about her; and it greatly benefitted from it.

				Hey, a TTRPG rulebook counts as a book.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've been very into dropout.tv recently, and I read this book to learn more about the system they're going to use for Dimension 20's next season. I liked it a lot! It's very simple and fun, and it looks like a very good way to introduce TTRPGs to people with little gaming experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				I do think it's a bit too loose with rules, however, and it's clearly more suited for oneshots or short campaigns rather than years-long epics. I think that's fine, but 5e combat is a guilty pleasure of mine, so I did find it a tiny bit lacking on the combat front... Which is fine, like, it's clearly not its main focus, but still!

				I've been playing this game on coop with my wife for the past couple weeks. Two or three hours every weekend. It completely took over my brain and I have fallen deep in love with it though we still understand very little about it and its world
			</p>
			<p>
				Rain World has some of the most satisfying movement I have ever played with on a videogame, but it makes you work for it. It feels a little bit like Session in that, like, you can tell that the game's controls have an incredibly high skill ceiling that will eventually become achievable to you even as you're stumbling with it and struggling to do the most basic moves. It fucks.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tumblr has given me some very very vague spoilers on the game's lore and plot, but they have all been so devoid of context I still know absolutely fucking nothing about it apart from the fact that we're probably going at this in an extremely wrong way that will soon bite us in the ass when we realize we could've started the plot if we had taken a different turn early on lmao.

				A delightful piece intended to be listened alongside James Benning's "Ten Skies" (2004). In my opinion it stands well enough on its own, but it's clearly intended to be experienced alongside the film, and that's the way I did.
			</p>
			<p>
				I enjoy ambient/drone music, so this wasn't a particularly difficult album for me, like, I have been fucking EATING with Patricia's output lately, and this one was as delightful as usual.
			</p>
			<p>
				I hadn't watched Ten Skies prior to this, so my impressions of both Ten Skies (2004) and Ten Skies (2024) are inextricably linked forever now. This is fine, obviously, but I have to wonder if I would've enjoyed the album more if I had already watched it in isolation. I don't think I could watch it without Patricia's score anymore, with how perfectly tuned to the visuals it is.
			</p>
			<p>
				To answer the question at the end of track 10 (which jumpscared me, by the way): I have recently been kind of into clouds/meteorology, and that obviously painted my listening experience, so I spent most of the album's duration looking at the clouds and thinking about how fast/slow they moved, what that meant about temperature and relative humidity, and how that translated into the music I was listening to.
			</p>
			<p>
				I had other thoughts, of course, but they relate more to the movie than the album, so they will go on that review instead

				I watched this movie alongside Patricia Taxxon's 2024 score, so my impressions of both pieces of art are inextricably linked forever now. This is fine, obviously, but I have to wonder if I would've enjoyed the movie as much if I had watched it in isolation. I don't think I could watch it without Patricia's score anymore anyways, with how perfectly tuned to the visuals it is.
			</p>
			<p>
				I enjoyed the movie. I've been into meteorology recently, so I spent most of it looking at the clouds and thinking about the sorts of conditions that would lead to their formation. I thought about the process of setting a camera up to film the sky, and how I would handle it if I were to ty recording something in this "found footage" kind of sky, which naturally segued into appreciating the way the camera is actually pointed up at the sky with absolutely no geographical landmarks suggesting when or where each of the titular skies were recorded: it's "the same sky" everywhere, and it feels nice to sit and look at that shared sky for 90 minutes in a context where most movies are filmed inside random green rooms in a Hollywood studio... Until you get gutpunched with the accidentally hilarious realization that it was all shot in fucking California anyways.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'd like to read Erika Balsom's essay about the film, but I don't have the first world disposable income to pay almost 25EUR to get a single essay shipped to me and I still haven't been able to find it scanned anywhere. I'll keep trying to download it every now and then, but it'll sadly have to wait for now.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's kinda funny that I'll have to wait to read the book, though. Like, soon enough I will have experienced and reviewed Ten Skies (2004), Ten Skies (2021) and Ten Skies (2024). Great fucking bit right there.

				Believe it or not, I had never watched this movie before!
			</p>
			<p>
				INSTANT favorite from Ghibli's catalog. It's absolutely <em>gorgeous</em>, it's incredible that it was all animated traditionally, like, digital animation is great and traditional is not "inherently superior" or anything, but it's hard not to appreciate the amount of work put into it, y'know?
			</p>
			<p>
				Really enjoyed both the worldbuilding and the visual design all throughout. I was very immersed all throughout, and it simultaneously felt much shorter and much longer than it actually was (in a good way!) ^^;
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm really tempted to rewatch it now that I'm typing this, dang.

				Surprise album drop!
			</p>
			<p>
				The game's control scheme would've sadly made me unable to enjoy it, so I can't speak for how well the album fits it :c I do think the acid techno "parallel nostalgiabait" was an inspired genre choice, though.

				Very cute concept! Played it in a single sitting with my wife and we enjoyed it a lot, though we felt it dragged on a little bit at times. Maybe we would've enjoyed it more if we had separated it into multiple sittings, but it felt like a single sitting kinda game, y'know?
			</p>
			<p>
				We experienced a very weird bug in the supermarket level where our objective stopped moving JUST out of our reach. We thought it was going to be the last level of the game and spent like 30 minutes wondering if it somehow had a weird anticlimactic ending, but it just worked fine upon relaunching it lol

				Incredibly spatious and tight-sounding. Found this album via related YouTube vids and I'm very very very glad I did.

				Interesting concept with a delightful presentation. I am absolutely obsessed with Vic's character and can't wait to see what the hell Season 2 turns into after that finale.

				Tommy Shriggly changed my brain chemistry.
