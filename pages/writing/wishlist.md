# Wishlist

## This page's purpose

I don't like receiving or making gifts. Obligatory gifts are expensive, wasteful, stressful and often burden the recipient with deciding what the fuck to do with an object they didn't need and social convention doesn't let them get rid of.

I think publicly available wishlists can help alleviate this problem. If you find yourself in a situation where you have to make me a gift for any reason whatsoever, it is much more healthy, honest and productive for everyone involved if everyone knows the kinds of gifts I would want and/or expect.

I can guarantee you I will appreciate and be very happy with _anything_ in this list. If you don't want to or can't afford the more expensive items, that's completely okay and expected! I do appreciate your intentions, but it would be easier for both of us to get nothing than to get something exclusively to fulfill a social contract.

I am aware that our culturally catholic society probably thinks, as usual, that I'm being an ungrateful brat by being clear about what I want; that I should be grateful for the giftgiver's good intentions and not look into a gift horse's mouth. I argue they can fuck right off, and it would be much more fun if we could all share our joy in the horse's impeccable dental hygiene instead of partaking in multiple layers of deception for what's supposed to be a nice occasion.

<div class="red thin border" style="color: var(--accent);">
I would rather get nothing than something from outside this list. I don't care about gifts, and I would rather you respect my agency in that regard than give me something random just to fulfill a social contract I am willingly signing out of.

## The List

Look, I appreciate the intention, I really do!
