# Weekly Bleats 1: Hello, world!

<img src="1.png">

Hi! Lena here.

I was home alone this week, which kinda made me fall into a hazy pit of just
sitting on my desk and scrolling Tumblr while watching videos on my second
screen. I don't think this is a morally wrong way to spend time (not a cop), but 
I have terminal Artist Disease and my mental health consistently tanks whenever 
I'm not planning or working on a creative project. So I started brainstorming
ways to use this website -to keep myself busy, if nothing else- and I got the
idea to start a weekly newsletter to both share stuff and keep myself 
accountable to do progress on my projects :3

This idea came at a great time I think? Like, it's the first week of the year! I
personally disagree with making a big deal out of calendar-based shit, but I
must admit there is an undeniable mystique to starting a big project right at
the start of the year. It will make calculating milestones and anniversaries way
easier, at the very least.

I look forward to this becoming part of my routine. It feels like something
the person I want to be would do, and that's fun~

## Updates

I started doing weekly comics! I intend to keep drawing one of these every week
to use them as banners in each installment of the newsletter.
I will also be posting the comics (with links to each newsletter update) on
Tumblr, so if you have a Tumblr you can indirectly follow the newsletter there I
guess?

My wife and I decided to track our sneezes this year as a silly
resolution/challenge thing! I intend to make a small web-app to visualize my
sneezes this year. I'll write more about this project when that is done, though.
For now, I can say I have only sneezed twice this week, both times in the last
24 hours.

I'm starting a [media log page]([#root#]medialog/index.html) where I will share what I
listen/read/watch/play this year. I intend to update this page every week when I
post a new installment of the newsletter, so keep an eye out if you somehow
think I have good taste :P If you also interacted with the art I add, feel free
to talk to me about it! Would love to hear people's opinions~

Since all of these projects are related to my website, it should come as no
surprise that I plan to do a full rewrite of it! This will probably take
multiple weeks, so I doubt it will be done by the time the next newsletter comes
out, but might as well share this here to start building some hype lmao. I'm
very excited about the ideas I have for this!

Finally: work on my upcoming webcomic, Dead End, has been picking up! I intend
to start posting pages sometime before this semester ends, and I'm super excited
about it. It's gonna be my biggest art project yet, and I really hope it goes
well. I'll talk more about it as progress continues, but for now just know
it's happening I guess :P

## Linkdump

* [[BLOG: Hundred Rabbits]](https://100r.co/site/home.html) Super interesting
  blog by two artists who live and work on a sailboat. I really like their work
  and their mission/philosophy resonated a lot with my own projects and goals.
  In a way, it inspired me to rethink the way I approach many things, and that
  must be worth something.
* [[GAME: Donsol]](https://donsol.tdjs.tech/) Dungeon crawler card solitaire.
  It plays like a very chill reduction of roguelike games. I've been playing it
  a lot both on my phone and with my pocket deck of solitaire cards, and it's
  definitely up there as one of my favorite solitaire games now... Maybe I
  should make my own solitaire variant, hmm...
* [[ARTICLE: How the press manufactured consent for never-ending COVID reinfections]](https://www.thegauntlet.news/p/how-the-press-manufactured-consent)
  I have been getting increasingly irritated about how we are being forced to
  normalize and ignore that there has been a mass disabling fully avoidable
  pandemic going on for the last four years. This article showcases how the
  media was used to frogboil into where we're at. It's US-centric, as fucking
  everything is online these days, but the narrative is beat-for-beat the same
  bullshit my country's local media pulled, so I must assume it applies to other
  places too.
* [[WEBSITE: msx.horse]](https://msx.horse) Emma Essex, of Vulpvibe, Lapfox and
  Halley Labs fame, recently did a full update of their website. Checking out
  her new site kinda jumpstarted the wave of inspiration that led to me creating
  this newsletter, so I felt like it was relevant enough to share~
