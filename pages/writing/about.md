# About Me

Hi! I'm Lena. I'm on my late 20s, I [pretend to be an artist](https://lensdeer.tumblr.com/tagged/lensdeerart), I dabble in [programming](https://github.com/marshdeer) and [web design]([#root#]home/index.html), I sometimes like to [write sophomoric-ass shit](../writing/index.html). I like playing [puzzle](../zach/index.html) and [arcade](../hiscore/index.html) videogames, and [experiencing various kinds of art](../medialog/index.html). This is my website.

In late 2022, growing disillusioned with the modern internet's enshittification and hostility, I deleted all my remaining social media accounts and returned to [tumblr](https://lensdeer.tumblr.com) to have a more earnest online presence. Over time, however, I grew tired of Tumblr Staff's mismanagement and decided to instead create [my own website](../index.html) as a hub for all my projects.

The [original version](https://github.com/MarshDeer/neocities/releases/tag/Backups) of this website was completely written by hand using vanilla [vim](https://vim.org) and an honestly ridiculous amount of patience. It was alright, but it was an absolute miserable pain to add new content to it, so I recently used a mix of [neovim](https://neovim.io) and [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/) to rewrite it from the ground up to use [autosite](https://autosite.somnolescent.net) instead.

Long-term, I intend to make this place a hub for all my projects. This necessarily means developing a bunch of infrastructure for it, which will need a huge amount of work and time that I can't always afford because of both day-to-day issues and my disability. It is a constant work-in-progress, so different parts might be unfinished at different points in time; I'm rationalizing that jank as transparency about my creative process, fuck it.

I consider my queerness, autism, anarchism, passion for free software, and being a furry and an artist to be very important to who I am as a person. There is infinitely more to me (and to everyone!) and to how those aspects affect me than I could possibly put cram together in a single article, so you will have to learn about those aspects of me through my work and/or eventual in-depth articles about them.

Thanks for reading! I hope you enjoy my website and my work: have fun exploring it, and then go and try to do the things you love. It's worth it~
