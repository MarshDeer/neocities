							In her "ethics of boinking animal people", Patricia says Bicycle was meant to create the same "furry species euphoria through textural sound design" that Alexander Panos's accidentally did in his album "Nascent". Needless to say, she succeeded! I am not therian myself, but I went into the album with that in mind and did get some degree of that almost-tactile feeling of being a lil deer. Good shit! Super strong start to the year. This album feels amazing to listen to and will definitely be one of my most listened this year.

						<p>
							Found this album through a youtube recommendation about Club Penguin's music. I was particularly drawn to the "found footage" concept; I think it's fascinating how *palpable* the caller's excitement was in "I Am Truly Fully Licensed Hairstylist" in particular. I thought it was interesting how the album immortalized her excitement at that particular moment of her life, idk. I felt happy for her all the way from over 20 years into the future, and I think that's cool.

							My Car Seat Headrest hyperfixation phase is long gone, but they remain a very important band for me. I listened to Twin Fantasy on loop around the time I started HRT in 2020, when I was finally starting to have some hope for the future for the first time in many, many years.
						</p>
						<p>
							I usually don't listen to live albums, but CSH gets special treatment. It... It was a live album, I guess? I had fun listening to it, but I don't think I have much to say about it apart from that.

							I admittedly know very little about rap/hip-hop, but this album's emotional content hit for me, and I've been told that's what these genres are supposed to be about?
						</p>
						<p>
							I don't have many distilled thoughts about this album, just that I've listened to each of its tracks multiple times just the day after first listening to them, so at least that shows how much I enjoyed it.

							I have no fucking idea how this album got to my music backlog, but I'm glad it did lmao. The basslines are funky as shit and the lyrics are catchy, so I'll probably end up coming back to it when I randomly get them stuck in my head months from now.

						Cixin Liu - Of Ants and Dinosaurs

						<p>
						When I got handed this book I was told it was "a political allegory about workers overthrowing their opressors", so I got excited and essentially expected it to be a more modern Animal Farm. Sadly, the book did not deliver.
						</p>
						<p>
						It suffers from an issue worryingly common in xenofiction stories with thinly-veiled allegories for a worker class: that one fucking trope where, while the workers can organize together and overthrow their oppressors, they eventually self-destruct because they are incompetent or biologically incapable of creative/independent thought. These stories, then, often go one of three ways: they give an anti-revolutionary message by framing overthrowing the ruling class as a fatal mistake with ramifications too complex for the oppressed's inferior minds to understand; they serve as colonialist propaganda by having the protagonist (often an outsider) step up as a natural leader with their superior creativity and/or intellect; or they frame ecocidal oppressors as the "lesser evil" at best or misunderstood good guys at worst by eventually returning to a marginally less oppressive status quo, usually with taken-down-a-peg oppressors still holding most (if not all) of the power.
						</p>
						<p>
						Needless to say, I fucking hate this trope, and was left extremely disappointed with the book. My instinct is to assume Liu's cultural context of growing up in Great Cultural Revolution-era China musthave painted his decision to include this trope in the book, he openly supported the country's government's antidemocratic mass control/surveillance policies and the Uyghur genocide during a The New Yorker interview in 2019, after all... But I admittedly don't know enough Chinese history to be fully sure this assumption doesn't come from internalized sinophobia, so don't quote me on this hot take I guess; I'm fully ready to drop it if I'm wrong.
						</p>
						<p>
						Anyways. What I'm trying to say here is that Pixar's A Bug's Life did the ants-as-workers concept better.

						Hundred Rabbits - Busy Doing Nothing

						<p>
							I found Hundred Rabbits' website a couple days ago. I spent a good chunk of today going through the huge amount of tabs from their website I had accumulated, leaving the open-source version of this book for last.
						</p>
						<p>
							I find Rekka and Devine's  situation extremely interesting. Their interests and thoughts mirror my own in many ways, so since I found out about them I've spent an embarassing amount of time thinking about what it would be like to live on a sailboat myself; to figure things out to a point where I could leave my deeply unsatisfying job behind and spend my energy and resources doing something more satisfying and closer to what I would like than, well, whatever the fuck it is I'm doing now.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm a bit sleepy right now, so I can't express my thoughts too coherently. The point is that I found the book extremely interesting and I'll probably be rotating it in my head for the next couple days.

						<p>
							It's more about the why, really.
						</p>
						<p>
							I enjoyed this book a lot. I was a bit tired of reading more fatalist texts, and it was nice to finally find a full book advocating against non-violence in the climate space specifically.
						</p>
						<p>
							The third chapter felt particularly important to me. Like, fuck Desert and all that primitivist "let's just give up" bullshit. We should at least try.
