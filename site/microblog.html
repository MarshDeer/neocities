		<h3>Fun</h3>

		<b>thoughts</b>
		<br>
		<p>
		It's raining!<br>
		I've spent most of this
		morning	working on
		optimizing the site's
		code. I also started
		building the "Fun links"
		section, so be on the
		lookout for that!<br>
		Sadly, instructions to
		create your own
		microblog will take a
		while to write and I'm
		going out later today,
		so that'll have to wait
		until tomorrow or monday
		probably :c

		<b>code</b><b>update</b><br>
		<p>
		Hi! I just created this
		small microblog window.
		It's a single-page pure
		HTML microblogging
		system that's designed
		to look good, cute, and
		easy to read both as a
		small iframe embedded on
		a website and as a
		proper website (press
		the maximize button!)
		where you can use CTRL+F
		to browse microposts
		based on tags.
		Instructions on how to
		add it to your website
		incoming to the main
		blog very soon!
		</p>
