		<p>
		Working on this website has been such
		a great excuse to work on pixelart.
		Particularly, giving up on finding an
		archive of Mac OS 6 icons sorta
		forced me to try 1 bit pixelart
		again... I had forgotten how much I
		liked it! I should do this more often
		lmao.

		<p>
		It's raining!<br>
		I've spent most of this morning
		working on optimizing the site's
		code. I also started building the
		"Fun links" section, so be on the
		lookout for that!<br> Sadly,
		instructions to create your own
		microblog will take a while to write
		and I'm going out later today, so
		that'll have to wait until tomorrow
		or monday probably :c

		<p>
		Hi! I just created this small
		microblog window.  It's a single-page
		pure HTML microblogging system that's
		designed to look good, cute, and easy
		to read both as a small iframe
		embedded on a website and as a proper
		website (press the maximize button!)
		where you can use CTRL+F to browse
		microposts based on tags.
		Instructions on how to add it to your
		website incoming to the main blog
		very soon!
		</p>
