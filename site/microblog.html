		<h1> Do I even need a links page? </h1>
		<time>2023-09-01</time>
		<span class="tag">#thoughts</span>
		<p>
		It's right there in this post's title,
		really.
		</p><p>
		I understand that a "cool links" page
		is a staple of personal websites, and
		that most neocities pages seem to have
		some version of one implemented, but I
		just seem to be absolutely unable to
		gather the inspiration/energy to
		actually code one, and I feel very
		awkward about that broken link in my
		nav links bar.
		</p><p>
		I guess this is a sort of announcement
		that the links page is postponed until
		further notice, and by the time anyone
		reads this I'll prob have taken it off
		my nav bar. On the bright side, now I
		feel like I can actually start working
		on the OC Archive! And I have gotten
		significantly better at CSS since I
		wrote the userstyle for this website,
		so I miiiiight start developing
		version 2.0 soon?

		<p>
		Oh boy it's been a while.
		</p><p>
		Where to even begin. Uh, I've done a
		bunch of things since that last post!<br>
		I made an <a href="hiscore.html" target="_top">arcade highscores archive</a> page
		with probably the best CSS I have
		written, I have been doing way more
		art, and yesterday I finished doing a
		friend's <a href="https://quantumvt.neocities.org" target="_top">website design</a> (also super
		proud of it!).
		</p><p>
		Been struggling to find motivation to
		do a lot of things, particularly to
		write more for this wesbite, but I
		think I got a new burst and I'll
		hopefully do a couple more updates
		soon~

		<span class="tag">#thoughts</span>
		<p>
		Just realized the tone of the
		previous post sounded kinda ominous
		to, like, just leave shit without any
		more updates lmao.<br>
		I'm okay. Recovery went/is going well
		and the scar is healing nicely,
		APPARENTLY some bleeding is fine but
		I wasn't debriefed on it so <span aria-label="shrug">Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯</span><br>
		Anyways, I added the microblog
		tutorial to the <a href="blog/microblogtutorial.html" target="_top">blog</a>,
		and I'm currently writing another
		post about my (mis)adventures turning
		my laptop into a moonlight-based thin
		client for my desktop computer. Fun
		maybe?

		<p>
		Surgery recovery started off great,
		but then I started getting a TON of
		anxiety that only got worse after I
		started actually spotting blood from
		the incision. I have my followup
		appointment tomorrow and my surgeon
		said not to worry, but of course I
		worry! Blood is supposed to be
		<em>inside</em> the body!... At any
		rate, this obviously has slowed down
		the creative drive I was feeling :c.<br>
		On the bright side, I'm finally
		satisfied enough with this website's
		stylesheet to be ready to call it a
		"1.0 version" once I finally get
		around to making the fucking links
		page.<br>
		Upcoming projects include an art
		archive, a heckscaper-style OC
		directory, writing a couple
		tutorials, finally getting started on
		my comic's concept art, and finally
		putting more Passionâ„¢ into this
		website.

		<span class="tag">#thoughts</span>
		<p>
		I'm finally back on my computer (kind
		of; using an underpowered laptop as
		a thin client counts, right?) after
		my orchiectomy. It feels weird to
		have finally had a Trans Surgeryâ„¢! I
		never expected to actually have one,
		but I'm glad I did :3 It'll be a nice
		impact on my QOL<br>
		At any rate, I got a bunch of time
		off work thanks to this, and this
		laptop is surprisingly good to type
		code on, so I'm gonna get to work on
		the microblog tutorial and some other
		code-related projects!

		<h1>Feature creep time!</h1>
		<time>2023-07-28</time>
		<span class="tag">#code</span><span class="tag">#update</span>
		<p>
		Spent most of my brainpower today
		trying to get backgrounds to remain
		pixel-perfect regardless of zoom
		level. As you might notice, this was
		a fucking failure.<br>
		On the bright side, I also added a
		filtering feature to the microblog,
		and spent a while going through the
		a11yproject checklist to hopefully
		make this website as accessible as
		possible! Still a WIP, however.<br>
		Anyways, my hyperfixation on web
		design remains strong, and I'm much
		closer to actually being able to
		focus on creating content for this
		website without getting distracted by
		developing infrastructure. Hype!

		<p>
		Working on this website has been such
		a great excuse to work on pixelart.
		Particularly, giving up on finding an
		archive of Mac OS 6 icons sorta
		forced me to try 1 bit pixelart
		again... I had forgotten how much I
		liked it! I should do this more often
		lmao.

		<p>
		It's raining!<br>
		I've spent most of this morning
		working on optimizing the site's
		code. I also started building the
		"Fun links" section, so be on the
		lookout for that!<br> Sadly,
		instructions to create your own
		microblog will take a while to write
		and I'm going out later today, so
		that'll have to wait until tomorrow
		or monday probably :c

		Hi! I just created this small
		microblog window.  It's a single-page
		pure HTML microblogging system that's
		designed to look good, cute, and easy
		to read both as a small iframe
		embedded on a website and as a proper
		website (press the maximize button!)
		where you can use CTRL+F to browse
		microposts based on tags.
		Instructions on how to add it to your
		website incoming to the main blog
		very soon!
